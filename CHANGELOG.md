## 0.4.0

Removed lints that were noisy
- `avoid_annotating_with_dynamic`
- `always_specify_types`

This will allow our org to start fresh with a clean set of recommended
lints (from `flutter_lints` and `lints`) that we can add to

## 0.3.0

- Updated Github actions test workflow to not run on tags
- Updated README to be clearer about suppressing lints

## 0.2.0

- Changed `lib/analysis_options.yaml` to `lib/recommend.yaml` to minimize confusion with package level
  `analysis_options.yaml` file

## 0.1.0

- Initial version.
